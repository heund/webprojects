# Korean Forest Deforestation Data Sonification

## Project Overview

This interactive data sonification project transforms Korean deforestation data into an immersive audiovisual experience. By converting environmental data into sound and combining it with visual elements, the project creates a unique way to understand and feel the impact of deforestation in Korea.

## Data Sources

1. **Forest Coverage Data**
   - Source: Korean Forest Service (산림청)
   - Time period: 2015-2020
   - Metrics: Annual deforestation rates, forest density

2. **Environmental Impact Data**
   - Source: National Institute of Forest Science (국립산림과학원)
   - Measurements: Soil composition, biodiversity indices
   - Additional metrics: Carbon storage, pH levels

3. **Climate Data**
   - Source: Korea Meteorological Administration (기상청)
   - Parameters: Local temperature changes, rainfall patterns
   - Correlation with forest coverage

   - Biomass loss → Volume
   - Soil health → Sound texture
   - Carbon levels → Filter effects

2. **Audio Features**
   - Real-time synthesis
   - Dynamic sound modulation
   - Spatial audio effects
   - Harmonic progressions

### Interactive Controls

# Prime Harmonic Network: A Synesthetic Experience

## Concept Overview

The Prime Harmonic Network is an interactive audiovisual exploration of the mathematical relationships between prime numbers, expressed through both sound and space. It creates a synesthetic experience where mathematical relationships become visible and audible, allowing users to explore the inherent harmony in prime number sequences. The project also features an interactive prime sequence, enabling users to directly engage with prime numbers and their corresponding frequencies, further enriching the synesthetic experience.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Prime Numbers and Harmony

Prime numbers, the fundamental building blocks of mathematics, have a unique relationship to musical harmony. When used as frequency ratios, they create pure, mathematically perfect intervals. This project explores these relationships by:

1. Using prime numbers to generate frequencies
2. Creating harmonic relationships based on prime ratios
3. Visualizing these relationships in 3D space

### The Formula

The core mathematical relationship is expressed as:

```
f_n = f_0 Ã— (p_n / p_1)

Where:
f_n = Resulting frequency
f_0 = Base frequency (440 Hz)
p_n = nth prime number
p_1 = First prime number (2)
```

## Visual Representation

### Network Structure

The visualization represents prime relationships as a living, breathing network where:

- Each node represents a prime-based frequency
- Connections show harmonic relationships
- Node positions are determined by mathematical proximity
- Depth and distance reflect harmonic intervals

### Visual Language

The aesthetic draws inspiration from:
- Scientific visualization
- Minimalist design
- Cybernetic systems
- Neural networks

The visual elements emphasize:
- Clarity of relationships
- Beauty of mathematical patterns
- Dynamic energy flow
- Interconnectedness

## Sonic Experience

### Harmonic Relationships

The sound design is based on pure harmonic relationships where:

1. **Prime Harmonics**
   - Each node produces a frequency derived from prime numbers
   - Intervals between nodes create pure mathematical ratios
   - Complex harmonies emerge from simple relationships

2. **Sound Propagation**
   - Sound travels through the network like ripples
   - Delays between nodes create rhythmic patterns
   - Spatial positioning reflects visual arrangement

### Musical Context

The project places these mathematical relationships in a musical context:

- Base frequency of A4 (440 Hz) grounds the sound in familiar territory
- Octave wrapping keeps frequencies in audible range
- Pure sine waves emphasize harmonic relationships
- Spatial effects add depth and dimension

## Interactive Experience
